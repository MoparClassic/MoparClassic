An emulator for an old Java MMORPG.

Setup
======
Install the Java 7 JRE and JDK
Install Apache Ant and Apache Ivy

Ensure all the paths are set correctly.

Go to LoginServer in the terminal/command prompt and type--
ant run

Go to GameServer in the terminal/command prompt and type--
ant run

You're now ready to start accept connections.

You may want to run the ConfigGenerator if you're not familiar with XMl. It will ask you a series of questions to help customize the config files for you. It will then replace the current config files with the one's you've generated.

Modules
========
To compile modules go in the module's directory and run the following command--
ant build

To use the module copy the newly created JAR into the modules folder in the respective server.  You may need to change some configuration files for the module to be used.

If you change data stores, it's suggested that you use the data store conversion utility.
