/**
 * This class is a collection which is backed by 3 seperate Sets.
 * 
 * These sets control the state of this collection.
 * 
 * To update this collections current state, you need to explicity call the
 * update method.
 * 
 * The purpose of this collection is to seperate new values added to this
 * collection untill the update method has been called. Removal of entities will
 * NOT take effect until the update method is called. This is so we can see what
 * is being removed (and in cases this is required by the server) to handle them
 * specially.
